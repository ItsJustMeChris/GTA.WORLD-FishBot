# GTA.WORLD-FishBot
Fishing bot for GTA World RP Server


Ported and updated version of Eclipse Role Play fishing bot to work on GTA World role play server.  

Notes: Safe to use from any anti cheat except for a heuristic based anti cheat, easily detectable by serverside anti cheat to log consistancy of typing the catch fish command, even if pasted in the server can detect it with a client side check for the 'ctrl' or 'v' or both keys being pressed when typing in the chat box to detect if pasted or not.  I may write a simple detection module for RageMP that can detect botting heuristically of jobs since many role play servers have a fishing job which is most likely botted.
